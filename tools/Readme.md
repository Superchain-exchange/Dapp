# Project Title

## Introduction

This project allows users to interact with Ethereum transactions. To ensure efficient transactions, users may need to adjust gas fees according to their needs.

## Adjusting Gas Fees

To change the gas fees for transactions, please modify the following parameters in the code:

```python
# Estimate the gas for the transaction
gas_price = web3.to_wei('0.51', 'gwei')  # Gas price in gwei
gas_limit = 40000  # Gas limit
transaction_cost = gas_price * gas_limit
